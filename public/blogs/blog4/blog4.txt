The First Light
Mornings in Wayanad aren’t noisy. They rise gently—through misty treetops, across sleepy spice plantations, and with the occasional rooster who’s a bit too ambitious. I sipped my first cup of tea on a bamboo balcony, watching the clouds roll over emerald hills. It wasn’t just scenic; it was poetic.

The Wild Side
If you love a bit of thrill, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is where you’ll find your heart racing. Spotting elephants in the distance, deer mid-leap, and even hearing the rustle of unseen paws—it’s like being inside a documentary, minus David Attenborough’s voiceover.

Edakkal Caves: Time Travel
Climbing up to the Edakkal Caves was sweaty but oh-so-worth it. The carvings inside date back to 6,000 BC, making them older than your college playlist. It felt surreal touching walls that held secrets from the Stone Age.

Local Love
Forget room service—Wayanad serves you on banana leaves, with flavors that dance on your tongue. From jackfruit chips to spicy Kerala beef fry, every bite was an invitation to slow down and savor.

Must-Do List:
Boat ride in Pookode Lake

Zipline through tea estates

Get a massage from the grannies who know what your back really needs

Goodbye, Not Really
Wayanad doesn’t say goodbye; it whispers, “Come back soon.” And you will.
