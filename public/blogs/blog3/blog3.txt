Introduction
When you sign up for the Chadar Trek, you’re not just saying yes to an adventure—you’re saying yes to nature at its most ruthless and breathtaking. For nine days, I walked over a frozen river in Ladakh, drank endless cups of butter tea, and had my limits—and heart—tested in every possible way.

Day 1: Arrival and Acclimatization
I landed in Leh in January, greeted not by a taxi but by -15°C air that smacked me wide awake. The first two days were all about letting your body adjust to the thin air and thick snow. It’s strange how quiet Leh feels in winter, like it’s holding its breath for something bigger.

Walking on Ice
The real trek began on the third day. Boots crunching on ice, breath fogging up like smoke—I felt like a character in a survival movie. The Zanskar River, frozen mid-dance, glistened below my feet. Slipping was inevitable. Laughing at yourself? Even more so.

The Chadar (which literally means “blanket of ice”) changes daily—what was solid today could be water tomorrow. We learned to read the river, to trust our guide, and to always have soup ready for sore knees and frozen fingers.

Night Camps & Conversations
Nights were brutal but beautiful. Tucked inside sleeping bags, wrapped like burritos, we watched stars that seemed close enough to touch. The conversations around the fire weren’t just about treks or work, but about life, love, and what it means to chase the extraordinary.

What I Learned
Your limits are far beyond what you think.

Nothing bonds people faster than sharing hand warmers.

Hot Maggi in the mountains tastes better than a 5-star meal.

Final Thoughts
If you ever doubt whether you can do something hard, go to Ladakh in winter. Walk the Chadar. Listen to your heartbeat echo across frozen valleys. And return—maybe bruised, definitely changed.
